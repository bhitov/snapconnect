# BondSnap

BondSnap mixes Snapchat-style snaps with regular chat, then layers on an AI relationship coach. Tap the üéì button in any conversation to open a private ‚Äúcoach chat,‚Äù where GPT-4 trained on Gottman Method research reviews recent messages, measuring the 5 : 1 positivity ratio, detecting the Four Horsemen, surfacing Love-Map gaps, and more. It returns real-time, plain-English advice, follow-up questions, and optional multi-paragraph analyses, plus extras like balance meters and group-energy checks to suggest concrete next steps or activities‚Äîall visible only to you and your partner or group.

A relationship-focused messaging app that combines ephemeral snaps with persistent text messaging and AI-powered relationship coaching.

### c) not recommended. Running the app with firebase emulators and android emulators

`npm install`
`mv env.local.bak .env.local`
download the `.env.local` file and put it in the root directory
build the firebase functions `cd functions. npm install. npm run build.`
run the firebase emulator `npm run emulator` or `npm run emulator:persist` if you want the data to be stored when you close the emulator
simultaneously, run expo go `npm run start`, then hit `a` to open up the android emulator.


## Sample data

I pregenerated a bunch of data to test out my AI responses. alex and emma are in a healthy relationship and jason and sarah are in an unhealthy relationship. Useful for making sure the ai responses are at least directionally correct

use the example data:

healthy relationship:
alex_chen@example.com
emma_davis@example.com

unhealthy relationship:
jason_miller@example.com
sarah_jones@example.com

all passwords are `pass123word`
