# Cursor Rules

## Core Development Philosophy

### Simplicity First - Anti-Complexity Enforcement

**absolute rule: always choose the simplest solution. never add layers to fix previous layers.**

#### core mindset:
- simple > complex always
- direct > indirect always
- fix the root cause, not the symptom
- delete code rather than add workarounds

### dry principle enforcement

**critical rule: follow the dry (don't repeat yourself) principle absolutely. never duplicate code, styles, or logic across multiple files.**
