# AI Relationship Coach Feature Plan

## Feature Summary

The AI Relationship Coach feature adds personalized relationship coaching to SnapConnect, allowing users to get expert guidance on their conversations and relationships. Each chat conversation can spawn a private "coach chat" where users interact with an AI relationship coach trained in Gottman Method principles.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Private Coaching**: One-on-one conversation with AI coach about any existing chat
- **Chat Analysis**: Detailed analysis of conversation patterns and relationship dynamics  
- **Proactive Guidance**: General relationship advice and communication strategies
- **Contextual Awareness**: Coach has access to the parent conversation for informed guidance
