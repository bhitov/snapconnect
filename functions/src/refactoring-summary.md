# Functions Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Refactored `functions/src/index.ts` to reduce code duplication by extracting common functionality into separate modules. The refactoring moved all coach-related functionality into dedicated modules, leaving index.ts as a clean entry point.

## New Modules Created

### 1. `db.ts` - Database Abstraction Layer
- Encapsulates all Firebase database operations
- Exports functions for:
  - `getCoachChatId()` - Check if coach chat exists
  - `createCoachConversation()` - Create new coach conversation
  - `saveTextMessage()` - Save messages to database
  - `getRecentMessages()` - Get recent messages from conversation
  - `getAllMessages()` - Get all messages from conversation
  - `formatMessagesForContext()` - Format messages for display

### 2. `pinecone.ts` - Pinecone Vector Database Utilities
- Centralizes Pinecone operations and analysis
- Exports:
  - `queryConversationMessages()` - Query messages with metadata
  - `analyzeConversationStats()` - Analyze sentiment and horsemen stats
  - `formatPineconeMessages()` - Format messages for display
  - `index` - Pinecone index instance
  - `DIM` - Embedding dimension constant
  - Interfaces: `MessageMetadata`, `ConversationStats`, `HorsemanCounts`

### 3. `coach.ts` - Coach Module with All Coach Functions
- Contains ALL coach functionality including:
  - **Utilities:**
    - `GOTTMAN_PROMPTS` - Object with all system prompts
    - `validateCoachParams()` - Validate common coach function parameters
    - `sendCoachMessage()` - Send and save coach messages
    - `callOpenAI()` - Centralized OpenAI API calls with logging
  - **Cloud Functions:**
    - `startCoachChat` - Creates coach chat for a conversation
    - `coachReply` - Handles user messages in coach chat
    - `coachAnalyze` - Analyzes conversation patterns
    - `coachRatio` - Analyzes positive/negative interaction ratio
    - `coachHorsemen` - Analyzes Four Horsemen patterns
    - `coachLoveMap` - Generates Love Map questions

## Refactoring Benefits

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**:
   - Eliminated repeated Pinecone query logic
   - Centralized sentiment/horsemen analysis
   - Unified message formatting
   - Single source for Gottman prompts

2. **Better Organization**:
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Database operations isolated in `db.ts`
   - Vector search logic in `pinecone.ts`
   - Coach-specific logic in `coach.ts`

3. **Improved Maintainability**:
   - Changes to database schema only require updates in `db.ts`
   - Pinecone query optimizations centralized
   - Consistent error handling and logging

4. **Type Safety**:
   - Shared interfaces for `MessageMetadata` and `ConversationStats`
   - Proper typing for all exported functions
   - Reduced type assertions needed

## Final Structure

- **`index.ts`** - Now a clean entry point that only:
  - Loads environment variables
  - Initializes Firebase app
  - Re-exports all coach functions from `coach.ts`
  
- **`coach.ts`** - Contains ALL coach-related code (600+ lines)
- **`db.ts`** - Database operations (120+ lines)
- **`pinecone.ts`** - Vector search operations (120+ lines)

## Next Steps

Potential further improvements:
1. Extract the Love Map topic embedding logic into a separate function
2. Create a unified error handling wrapper
3. Add unit tests for the extracted modules
4. Consider extracting the OpenAI embedding calls
