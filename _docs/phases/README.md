# SnapConnect Development Phases

## Overview
SnapConnect is built through four iterative phases, each delivering a functional product that builds upon the previous phase. This approach ensures we maintain a working application throughout development while progressively adding features and polish.

## Phase Summary

### ðŸ“‹ [Phase 1: Setup - Foundation](./phase-1-setup.md)
**Duration**: 2-3 days  
**Status**: Not Started

**Key Deliverables**:
- âœ… Running React Native app with TypeScript
- âœ… Project structure following architectural patterns
- âœ… Theme system implemented
- âœ… Basic navigation structure
- âœ… Development environment configured
- âœ… Firebase project initialized

**Purpose**: Establish a solid technical foundation with proper tooling, structure, and configurations that all future development will build upon.

---

### ðŸš€ [Phase 2: MVP - Core Functionality](./phase-2-mvp.md)
**Duration**: 5-7 days  
**Status**: Not Started

**Key Deliverables**:
- âœ… User authentication (register/login)
- âœ… Camera with photo/video capture
- âœ… Send and receive disappearing snaps
- âœ… Basic friend system
- âœ… 24-hour auto-deletion
- âœ… Black & white filter

**Purpose**: Deliver the minimum viable product that demonstrates the core value proposition of ephemeral messaging.

---

### ðŸŒŸ [Phase 3: Social Features - Enhanced Engagement](./phase-3-social.md)
**Duration**: 5-7 days  
**Status**: Not Started

**Key Deliverables**:
- âœ… Stories (24-hour posts)
- âœ… Group messaging
- âœ… Push notifications
- âœ… Google OAuth login
- âœ… UI animations and polish
- âœ… Story replies

**Purpose**: Transform the basic messaging app into a full social platform with features that drive engagement and retention.

---

### ðŸ’Ž [Phase 4: Polish & Scale - Premium Experience](./phase-4-polish.md)
**Duration**: 7-10 days  
**Status**: Not Started

**Key Deliverables**:
- âœ… Advanced AR filters
- âœ… Text chat with history
- âœ… Voice/video calling
- âœ… Premium subscriptions
- âœ… Discover feed
- âœ… Performance optimization

**Purpose**: Elevate SnapConnect to a premium platform with advanced features, monetization, and infrastructure ready for scale.

## Development Timeline

```
Week 1:  [Phase 1: Setup        ] 
Week 2:  [Phase 2: MVP                              ]
Week 3:  [        MVP cont.    ][Phase 3: Social    ]
Week 4:  [       Social cont.      ][Phase 4: Polish]
Week 5:  [            Polish & Scale cont.          ]
```

Total estimated development time: **19-26 days**

## Key Principles

### 1. **Iterative Development**
Each phase produces a working product. We never have long periods without a functional app.

### 2. **User Value First**
Features are prioritized by user value. Core functionality comes before nice-to-haves.

### 3. **Technical Excellence**
Proper architecture and patterns are established early to avoid technical debt.

### 4. **Continuous Testing**
Each phase includes comprehensive testing to maintain quality.

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success
- App runs on both platforms
- All developers can contribute
- Foundation supports future features

### Phase 2 Success
- Users can complete core flow
- 100+ test users successfully send snaps
- <1% crash rate

### Phase 3 Success
- 50% of users post stories
- 30% use group messaging
- 80% enable notifications

### Phase 4 Success
- 10% convert to premium
- <2s app launch time
- 99.9% uptime

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Firebase scaling issues
- **Mitigation**: Plan for migration paths early

### Timeline Risks
- **Risk**: Features take longer than estimated
- **Mitigation**: Each phase is self-contained and shippable

### Quality Risks
- **Risk**: Bugs accumulate across phases
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing at each phase

## Getting Started

1. Review all phase documents
2. Set up development environment (Phase 1)
3. Follow phases sequentially
4. Don't skip ahead - each phase builds on the previous
5. Test thoroughly before moving to next phase

Remember: The goal is to have a working, valuable product at the end of each phase. This iterative approach ensures we deliver value early and often while building towards the full vision of SnapConnect.
