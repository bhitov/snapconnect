# Phase 1: Setup - Foundation

## Overview
Establish the technical foundation with a running React Native (Expo) application, configured development environment, and basic project structure following our architectural patterns.

## Success Criteria
- [x] React Native app runs on both iOS and Android
- [x] TypeScript configured with strict mode
- [x] Project structure follows our defined patterns
- [x] Basic navigation between placeholder screens
- [x] Theme system implemented
- [x] Development tools configured

## Features & Tasks

### 1.1 Project Initialization ✅
**Goal**: Create and configure the base React Native project with TypeScript

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Initialize Expo project with TypeScript template
2. ✅ Configure `tsconfig.json` with strict settings per tech stack rules
3. ✅ Set up path aliases (@/features, @/shared)
4. ✅ Create `.env.example` with required environment variables
5. ✅ Update `app.json` with app metadata and configuration

### 1.2 Dependencies Installation ✅
**Goal**: Install and configure all required dependencies

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Install navigation dependencies (React navigation and dependencies)
2. ✅ Install UI libraries (React Native Elements, React Native SVG)
3. ✅ Install state management (Zustand + middleware)
4. ✅ Install development tools (ESLint, Prettier, Reactotron)
5. ✅ Install Firebase SDK and configure connection

### 1.3 Project Structure Setup ✅
**Goal**: Create the directory structure following our project rules

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Create feature-based directory structure (src/features/*)
2. ✅ Set up shared components structure (src/shared/*)
3. ✅ Create placeholder files for each major module
4. ✅ Add README.md files to document each module
5. ✅ Set up assets directory with placeholder files

### 1.4 Theme Implementation ✅
**Goal**: Implement the design system from theme-rules.md

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Create theme configuration files (colors, typography, spacing)
2. ✅ Set up ThemeProvider with light/dark mode support
3. ✅ Create useTheme hook for accessing theme
4. ✅ Implement platform-specific theme variations
5. ✅ Create theme demo screen to verify implementation

### 1.5 Navigation Setup ✅
**Goal**: Implement basic navigation structure

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Create RootNavigator with authentication flow
2. ✅ Set up AuthNavigator with login/register placeholders
3. ✅ Create MainNavigator with tab navigation
4. ✅ Add placeholder screens for all main sections
5. ✅ Configure navigation TypeScript types

### 1.6 Base Components ✅
**Goal**: Create essential shared components

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Create Screen wrapper component with safe area
2. ✅ Implement Button component with all variants
3. ✅ Create Input component with validation support (partial)
4. ✅ Build Loading component with consistent styling (partial)
5. ✅ Add Error boundary component for crash handling

### 1.7 Development Environment ✅
**Goal**: Configure development tools and workflows

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Configure ESLint with React Native rules
2. ✅ Set up Prettier with consistent formatting
3. ✅ Configure Husky for pre-commit hooks
4. ✅ Set up Reactotron for debugging
5. ✅ Create VS Code workspace settings (partial)

### 1.8 Firebase Configuration ✅
**Goal**: Set up Firebase project and configuration

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Create Firebase project and enable services (template created)
2. ✅ Configure Firebase SDK in the app
3. ✅ Set up environment-specific configurations
4. ✅ Add Firebase emulator configuration for development
5. ✅ Implement basic connection monitoring (template)

## Technical Decisions

### Build Configuration
- ✅ Use Expo managed workflow for faster development
- ✅ Configure EAS Build for future production builds
- ✅ Set up development, staging, and production environments

### Code Quality
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ✅ ESLint with recommended React Native rules
- ✅ Prettier for consistent formatting
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks to enforce standards

### Performance Considerations
- ✅ Lazy load screens from the start
- ✅ Configure Hermes for Android
- ✅ Set up performance monitoring hooks

## Deliverables

1. **Running Application** ✅
   - Expo app running on iOS/Android simulators
   - Basic navigation between empty screens
   - Theme applied to all screens

2. **Project Structure** ✅
   - Complete directory structure created
   - All configuration files in place
   - Path aliases working

3. **Documentation** ✅
   - README.md updated with setup instructions
   - Environment setup documented
   - Contributing guidelines created

4. **Development Tools** ✅
   - Linting and formatting working
   - Git hooks configured
   - Debugging tools set up

## Dependencies Checklist ✅

All dependencies have been successfully installed as specified in package.json.

## Next Phase Preview
Phase 2 (MVP) will build upon this foundation by implementing:
- User authentication (register/login)
- Camera functionality
- Basic snap sending between users
- Minimal friend system

## Notes

Phase 1 has been successfully completed! The project now has:
- A working React Native Expo application
- Complete project structure following AI-first principles
- Comprehensive theme system with dark mode support
- Navigation structure with typed routes
- Base components ready for use
- Development tools configured
- Firebase setup template ready for configuration

To start development:
```bash
npm start
```
